<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The national elections in Guinea are scheduled to hold on 11<sup>th</sup> October 2015, and the women of Guinea have been charged to promote women&#8217;s electoral participation and political representation in the forthcoming elections in the country.</p>
<p>The ECOWAS Commissioner for Social Affairs and Gender, Dr. Fatimata Dia Sow gave this charge at the opening of the Gender and Elections training workshop in Conakry, on the 1<sup>st</sup> of October 2015.</p>
<p>The training workshop which uses the BRIDGE (Building Resources in Democracy, Governance and Elections (BRIDGE) methodology and supported by the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) has already been held for women and stakeholders in Togo, Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Cote d’Ivoire.</p>
<p>Commissioner Sow who was represented by the ECOWAS Director of Gender Dr. Sintiki Ugbe, informed the 40 participants that the training is aimed at strengthening their capacities for enhanced political engagement and greater inclusion of women in national democratic processes.</p>
<p>“We are proud that our community citizens and women in particular have contributed to the peaceful elections in Togo and Nigeria. We pay tribute to the women in Togo and Nigeria for their untiring efforts to ensure the conduct of peaceful and successful elections. We are confident Burkina Faso, Cote d’voire and Guinea will follow the precedence already set” the Commissioner added.</p>
<p>She urged the participants to sensitise the citizenry against all forms of electoral violence, and the need for political actors and stakeholders to abide by the code of conduct provisions of the African Charter on elections, democracy and good governance. The code includes a commitment by political stakeholders to accept the results of the elections or challenge them through legal channels.</p>
<p>Commissioner Sow congratulated the Government and People of Guinea on their national independence anniversary on the 2<sup>nd,</sup> of October, and used the occasion to commend them for their dogged fight and resilience against the dreaded scourge of Ebola.</p>
<p>The Guinean Minister of Social Affairs and the Promotion of Women and Children (MASPFE), represented by the Minister of Environment, Madam Kajiatu N’Diaye said the workshop is auspicious as the Ministry has been working hard at improving the representation of women in decision making positions at all levels.</p>
<p>She noted that women’s participation is indispensable to the development of the Guinean economy and the attainment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p>The minister maintained that the social conditions of women in Guinea needs improvement to enhance their status in the larger society. Madam N’Diaye re-called the adoption of the African Union (AU) Charter and other legal instruments on democracy, good governance and elections by the Guinean government as a demonstration of the commitment to the protection of human rights. In her final remarks, the Minister commended ECOWAS Commission on this important initiative.</p>
<p>Among the dignitaries that attended the Opening Ceremony of the training workshop were the Special Representative of the ECOWAS Commission President to Guinea, Madam Zaba N. Jacqueline Marie, the former Minister of Public Function, Madam Makale Traore, the Director General, Centre for the Support and Self Promotion of Women (CAAF), Madam Fatoumata Traore, and the Director of Cabinet, Ministry of Defence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gender equity with the ultimate goal of promoting greater participation of women in electoral processes in the region is at the heart of a training workshop being organised by ECOWAS in conjunction with the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) in Conakry, Guinea from the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 3<sup>rd</sup> of October 2015.</p>
<p>The training workshop is in recognition of the vital role of women on lasting peace and in the prevention and resolution of conflict. It aims among others to educate women about the importance of empowering their kind as well as the gender mainstreaming point of entry in the electoral process.</p>
<p>It will also inform civil society and women advocacy groups regarding strategies to promote women&#8217;s participation in electoral processes as well as provide all participants of critical appraisal tools of elections from a gender perspective; and to offer women advocacy groups an opportunity for networking.</p>
<p>ECOWAS training on gender and elections will use the internationally recognised training program: &#8220;Building Resources in Democracy, Governance and Elections (BRIDGE) model with special emphasis on the module on Gender &amp; Elections</p>
<p>The Conakry training would also afford the opportunity for an appraisal of important issues such  as gender stereotypes, psychological and traditional barriers and inequalities in education, training and resources, violence based on gender, inadequate institutions for protection and enforcement of women&#8217;s political rights, the exclusion of women in peace negotiations and consultations meant to determine the type and details of the electoral process; and the Lack of international and national investment in women grouping as actors around common political programmes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking on the upcoming event, the ECOWAS Director for Gender Dr. Sintiki Ugbe notes that “the ECOWAS Commission plays a crucial role in preventive diplomacy and other activities for consolidation of democracy and peace. Democratic elections are seen as a crucial elements in consolidating peace. One cannot emphasize strongly enough the importance of elections as lasting solutions to conflicts. Peace and national prosperity cannot be achieved if the institutions are not democratic and representative of all groups in society, such as women, youth, men, minorities and the majority, the poor and the rich”</p>
<p>Gender experts have always maintained that if women&#8217;s groups can effectively organize themselves, they can play a major role in facilitating and supporting increased political participation.<br />
The training workshop will be attended by representatives of women&#8217;s organizations engaged in election activities of the election administration and the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs of the respective member states.</p>
<p>The support for Gender and Elections Training for five of the countries with elections in 2015 namely; Nigeria, Togo, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire and Guinea is funded DANIDA.</p>
<p>The ECOWAS Commission through the support of DANIDA and in collaboration with the Ministries of Women Affairs has successfully conducted the BRIDGE-Gender Elections in Nigeria, Togo, Burkina Faso and Cote d’Ivoire.</p>
<p>The recognition of the need to involve women in all aspects of peace and international security led to the adoption of Resolution 1325 by the UN Security Council in the year 2000. The resolution calls for action in four areas related to women, peace and security.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) and the UN Women are collaborating to establish a five million Euro small grant Facility for more energy availability in West Africa.</p>
<p>Known as ECOW-GEN, the Facility is a funding vehicle created for the purpose of operationalizing the ECOWAS Policy for Gender Mainstreaming in Energy Access, which was validated by the region’s energy and gender experts in June 2015.</p>
<p>Specifically, the joint effort is meant to provide technical and financial support to upscale the deployment of projects which would promote gender equality and improve energy access in the region at the same time.</p>
<p>The ECOWAS Policy for Gender Mainstreaming in Energy Access aims to address existing barriers to the equal participation of men and women in expanding energy access in the region, and thus contribute to the success of the sustainable Energy for All (SE4AL) initiative in the ECOWAS region.</p>
<p>In aid of this, ECOW-GEN Facility which runs from June 2016 – 2019 would focus on promoting gender-responsive investments and business development by transforming women-led business ideas in energy into real, commercially viable enterprises.</p>
<p>The Facility is meant to aid and contribute towards technology development and transfer; knowledge and skills acquisition; and establishment of sustainable energy businesses. It would also identify gender-responsive projects through annual calls for proposals.</p>
<p>With an initial €500,000 it is billed to commence with a pilot phase lasting up till June 2016, supporting between about 7 to 10 energy projects. In this regard, calls for project proposals for the Facility’s pilot phase opens on 12 October 2015m while applicants may apply for any of the Facility’s three components, namely: the ECOWAS Women’s Business Fund; the Women’s Technical Exchange Program; and Women Economic Empowerment through Energy for Productive Uses.</p>
<p>Organizations eligible for financing include government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in the 15 ECOWAS Member States, international and local civil society organizations (CSOs), women and community-based groups and associations (including youth organizations, entrepreneurs, private sector organizations, the academia and research institutions.</p>
<p>The partners which are supporting the energy access facility include the Austrian Development Cooperation (ADC), the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID), the United States’ National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) is inviting research teams to submit policy research proposals in identified energy fields for its research grant programme that is being launched.</p>
<p>The identified fields include but is not limited to energy technologies, energy finance, energy economics, energy policy, energy and the environment/climate change, energy and development, energy law.</p>
<p>Teams will receive a grant amount of not more than €1500 to contribute to the formulation of evidence-based energy policies or strategies in the region.</p>
<p>The Research Grant Program is part of the ECOWAS initiative on Youth Leadership Development in Energy, which works to prepare the region’s young men and women to become globally competitive energy leaders in the future.</p>
<p>Aligned with the initiative’s objective, the research grant program aims to build and strengthen the capacity of young West Africans to contribute and participate actively in the energy discourse at the national and regional levels and, thus, ensure that the youth has a say in the way energy development is shaped in West Africa.</p>
<p>With the recent launch of the West African Energy Leaders Groups (a regional branch of the African Energy Leaders Group &#8211; AELG) under the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL), the goal is that the program will represent a knowledge generating body that contributes to the AELG’s core objectives by producing well-researched, academic papers to guide and inform economic and political decision-makers towards the transformation of the region’s energy sector.</p>
<p>The Program will, thus, support research teams with research proposals that are ambitious and innovative, and aimed at generating new knowledge for decision making.</p>
<p>ECREEE is inviting potential partners to join this initiative. These may include universities, private companies, corporate foundations, civil society organizations and professional associations.</p>
<p>The Centre has also announced that research papers would be published electronically on the ECOWAS Energy Journal and made available on the ECREEE e-library while researchers will be given the opportunity to share their findings and recommendations at conferences and workshops organized by ECREEE.</p>
<p>The Research Grant Program is supported by the ECOWAS Commission, the Austrian Development Cooperation (ADC), the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and Development (AECID), the U.S National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).</p>
<p>Additional information on the call for proposal for the research grant program including the concept note for the ECOWAS initiative on Youth Leadership Development can be obtained at <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.ecowgen.ecreee.org\n\nThis file was not retrieved because it was filtered out by your project settings.\n\nWould you like to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.ecowgen.ecreee.org'">www.ecowgen.ecreee.org</a></p>

<p>DONE IN ABUJA THIS 22ND<br />
DAY OF SEPTEMBER 2015<br />
THE AUTHORITY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OPENING ADDRESS BY H.E. MR. MACKY SALL,</strong></p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL, </strong></p>
<p><strong>CURRENT CHAIRMAN OF THE AUTHORITY OF ECOWAS HEADS OF STATE AND GOVERNMENT</strong></p>
<p><strong> EXTRAORDINARY SUMMIT OF THE AUTHORITY OF ECOWAS HEADS OF STATE AND GOVERNMENT</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>President Muhammadu Buhari, our host,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My dear Colleagues,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Honourable Ministers,</strong></p>
<p><strong>The President of the ECOWAS Commission,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ambassadors, </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Special Representative and Head of the United Nations Office for West Africa,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ladies and Gentlemen,</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After our Extraordinary Summit on 13 September in Dakar, here we are again, meeting to deliberate on an emergency situation facing our sub region.</p>
<p>I would like to thank our brother Muhammadu Buhari for his kindness in receiving us under such short notice. Thank you, too, dear colleagues, for leaving your busy schedules to be here.</p>
<p>As we are all aware, on 17 September, members of the Presidential Guard (RSP) disrupted the transition process in Burkina Faso, ousting President <strong>Michel Kafando</strong>, the Prime Minister and Members of Government.</p>
<p>From 18 September, I, along with our colleague <strong>Thomas Boni Yayi</strong>, went to Ouagadougou to inquire into the situation, engage in consultations with all the stakeholders, and help find a way to end the crisis.</p>
<p>The President of the Commission, <strong>Kadré Désiré Ouédraogo</strong>, and the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for West Africa, <strong>Mohamed Ibn Chambas</strong> were already in the country to meet with the International Follow-up and Support Group for the Transition in Burkina Faso.</p>
<p>Together, we met the political class and the other stakeholders, including the civil society.</p>
<p>President Boni Yayi and I met extensively with President Kafando in his residence, and also with General Diendéré.</p>
<p>I was able to personally meet President Kafando to inquire as to the conditions of his detention, listen to his analysis of the situation, his concerns and opinions and to find out if he was willing to continue as President of the Transition, which he agreed to. We were able to discuss in detail on all the points that could help bring about a peaceful resolution of the crisis.</p>
<p>After the departure of President Boni, I, along with President Kadre and Mr. Chambas, visited the Palais de Kossyam on Sunday, to meet with General Diendéré and representatives of the RSP.</p>
<p>This meeting had more to do with informing than negotiating.</p>
<p>I explained clearly to all, the extreme gravity of what they had done; the damaging consequences on the country, and the serious risks that will result thereof, firmly stressing ECOWAS’ strong opposition to any forceful take-over of power, and demanding that they hand back the reins of government unconditionally to the transition authorities.</p>
<p>I reminded them of the fact that in any normal democracy, the military is under obligation to submit to the civil authority; and that the RSP has no right to dictate conditions to the country, interfering in the political scene.</p>
<p>This, my dear colleagues is how things stand in Burkina Faso. <strong>Our role is to put an end to the escalation of things in order to prevent the country from descending into violence. </strong>Deaths and injuries have been recorded; property plundered. Whole families and their property are being targeted for their affiliation to this or that camp. Some, fearing for their life, left surreptitiously. On all sides, there are die-hard extremists.</p>
<p>As a proof, on 20 September, within the confines of my hotel, I saw, with my own eyes, civilians beating up other civilians.</p>
<p>Given the circumstance, I must express, dear colleagues, <strong>my grave concern. I solemnly warn our Summit </strong>on the gravity of the situation in Burkina Faso, even though our sub region has come under severe attack from other sources of instability.</p>
<p>It is expedient that we act while there is still time, to avoid an impasse and utter chaos.</p>
<p>I present to you, for your consideration today, the draft Political Agreement for a way out of the crisis which I had presented to all the stakeholders last Sunday.</p>
<p>This draft document takes due account of the decision made by the African Union, in line with its legal texts, to condemn the coup d’Etat, suspend Burkina Faso from the African Union governing bodies with immediate effect, and demand the release of authorities detained and the reinstatement of the transition organs, under penalty of sanctions against the coup organisers.</p>
<p>The draft document also draws from the seven convergence points proposed by the mediators of the National Reconciliation Commission, made up of Archbishop Paul Ouédraogo, the former President Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo, the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence and the Chief of Defence Staff.</p>
<p>We have also taken into account opinions and concerns raised by President Kafando and all the other lead actors; in a manner that includes all positions, and proposes a solution that is sustainable on the whole over and beyond the situation caused by the coup d’Etat.</p>
<p>The document before you today mainly includes the following salient points:</p>
<p><strong>Firstly, there is the non-negotiable demand for the release of all the authorities detained the re-establishment of the transition regime and reinstating of President Kafando.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I recall that it was ECOWAS that helped set up the consensual transition regime</strong> after the civil revolt of October 2014, and consequently made it possible to waive off the application of sanctions on the country by the African Union and our partners. We are therefore unable to accept the disruption of a process that we authorized.</p>
<p><strong>Also, the withdrawal of the military from government for the remaining period of the transition seems crucial, because the army, like the political class and civil society organisations, is strongly divided.</strong> It is needful to avoid, at all costs, a confrontation even within the Burkinabe army.</p>
<p><strong>The draft Agreement, also calls for an open, inclusive, free and transparent electoral process.</strong> These are universal principles of democracy, resulting in the sincerity and credibility of any democratic election. The process would otherwise leave room for post election petitions.</p>
<p><strong>Furthermore, we had hoped to take into account particularly delicate matters that require a long term process towards stabilizing the country.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Hence the proposed reform of the defence and security forces, including the Presidential Guard. </strong>From the start of the transition regime, we had wondered whether the regime could handle the resolution of such a controversial matter that has remained unresolved to date. For this reason, at the start of the facilitation mission that was entrusted to me following the people’s revolt of October 2014, and owing to concerns for the stability of the transition regime, I had suggested that this sensitive dossier should be left to the future elected President to resolve; because he would be vested with the rightful authority;.</p>
<p><strong>Dear colleagues, </strong></p>
<p>All considerations made, what remains is the crucial issue of national reconciliation, without which co-habitation would remain impossible within one indivisible Nation.</p>
<p>One can understand and accept the frustrations and the rancour.</p>
<p>But whenever we are consigned to building a common destiny, then pardon and reconciliation becomes humanly needful in order to give credence to the common will for a unified community.</p>
<p><strong>That is the goal of the proposal for amnesty contained in the draft Agreement. </strong>We are hardly encouraging impunity, rather an effort to appease hearts and foster national unity, while paving the way for a sustainable peace endeavour.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that where others have trod and have succeeded, including the defeat of the odious apartheid regime, the Burkinabe people possessing the same largeness of heart and spirit to go the extra mile, can also succeed and overcome at this critical phase in its history.</p>
<p>This is the basis of the amnesty proposal.</p>
<p>In the same vein, I recommend that for the sake of human solidarity, the Organisation should give a sum of one million dollars to compensate families of those who died or were injured in events that followed the coup d’Etat of 17 September.</p>
<p>On behalf of you all, I express my condolence and sympathy to families plunged into mourning, and our wishes for the quick recovery of the injured.</p>
<p>I once again solemnly appeal to the entire political class, civil authorities, military and to all stakeholders in Burkina Faso, the Burkinabe people in their entirety, to spare this country we love from the misfortune of a conflict.</p>
<p>If the country were to descend into violence, our conversation would shift from respecting election deadlines, conducting polls, counting voting ballots; to weapons, the number of dead and injured persons. This would be a distressing outlook for the country, our sub-region and our continent.</p>
<p>So, we call on those stirring trouble and chaos to desist, and for everyone to give careful consideration to the outcome of their actions.</p>
<p>I thank you for your kind attention and declare open the proceedings of our Summit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
